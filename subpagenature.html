           <p class="text_float">The mountain with its head in the clouds, also known as Ben Nevis, is the highest mountain in Scotland and the UK. With a summit of 1,345 meters above sea level,
            <img src="images/bennevisbridge.jpg" alt="bridge" class="bridgepic"> it is the highest land in any direction for 459 miles. It lies just at the western end of the Grampian Mountains in the Highland region of Lochaber, its neighboring town being Fort William. The locals refer to the mountain as “The Ben”. 
            Millions of years ago, Ben Nevis was once a massive active volcano which exploded and collapsed inwards on itself. 
            <br><br>
            So, what do you need to know when climbing Ben Nevis? This mountain may seem daunting, but it is actually welcomed for beginners. A total of 7-9 hours is approximately what it will take to complete the Mountain Track. And yes, your legs will feel like jello the next day. 
            Be aware that the weather on Ben Nevis can be vastly different to that of the ground
            <img src="images/bennevisrocks.jpg" alt="rocks" class="rockspic"> and can change dramatically, usually for the worse. Prepare with wind and waterproof clothing. It may be summer at the bottom but will quickly turn to winter as you near the summit. One minute it can be sunny and warm, and the next you are getting pegged by hail and wind. Once you reach the clouds, it will become very difficult to see more than a few feet in front of you.
            <br><br>
            As you begin your climb, you will take in the beauty of Scotland and all its greenery. The trails will start out as a normal hike, then progress to get steeper and rockier. Reaching the top, you will feel as if you have left Scotland and entered another world, looking upon and trying not to twist your ankle on all the rock beneath you. Getting back down the mountain is just as much of a challenge as going up. Needless to say, you will feel a great sense of achievement once you have conquered “The Ben”.
