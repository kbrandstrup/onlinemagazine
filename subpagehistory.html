            <p class="text_float">Edinburgh Castle is known for its dark and fascinating history. The castle has witnessed its fair share of death and misery over the centuries, with plenty of witch 
                <img src="images/castlefountain.jpg" alt="castle" class="fountain_img"> burning, prisoner torturing, and royal treason.  Though there are many stories of what went on behind the doors of Edinburgh Castle, just one will be spoken of today. The most bloody and malicious, one might say, is the tale of Lady Jane Douglas.
                <br><br>
                16th century Britain was well known for their witchcraft trials. James V held resentment towards the powerful Douglas family due to a troublesome history. Jane Douglas’ first husband, John, Lord Glamis died and she remarried to Archibald Campbell of Skipness. Many men tried to win Jane’s heart after the passing Lord Glamis. One of those men, William Lyon, was intensely jealous of her new husband, Archibald. He accused Jane, her son, and priest John Lyon of treason. The King believed the lie. Jane was then accused of
                <img src="images/edinburghcastleview.jpg" alt="cityviewcastle" class="castleview_img"> attempting to poison the king and practicing witchcraft.
                <br><br>
                She was tortured, sometimes in front of her son, who also received the same barbaric treatment. A confession was obtained through brutal mutilation, and this gave the king the “go ahead” to punish Jane for her alleged witchcraft and conspiring plots. She was sentenced to death based on her own false confession and was burned at the stake, while her husband and son watched helplessly from a cell in David’s tower. 
                <br><br>
                Not long after, her husband Archibald, died after he supposedly attempted an escape, though suicide is believed to possibly have been his motivation. Her son, the young Lord Glamis, was released in 1542 when James V died and the priest John Lyons was exiled. Lady Jane is now said to haunt the castle.
